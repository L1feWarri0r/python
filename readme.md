#Language Translator Application
The "Language Translator" application is a simple GUI tool that allows users to perform language translation and speech recognition. It utilizes the Google Translate API for language translation and the Speech Recognition library for speech-to-text functionality.

#Features
Translate text from one language to another.
Recognize speech and convert it to text.
Requirements
To run the "Language Translator" application, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
tkinter (usually included with Python)
googletrans (Google Translate API library)
speech_recognition (Speech Recognition library)
You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
pip install SpeechRecognition

#Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have installed the required dependencies mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

Run the "language_translator.py" script to start the application.

The main application window will appear. Here, you can perform language translation and speech recognition tasks.

#Translation
Enter the text you want to translate in the "Source Text" entry field.
Select the destination language from the dropdown list provided in the "Destination Language" combobox.
Click the "Translate" button to initiate the translation process.
The translated text will be displayed in the "Result" label below the "Translate" button.

The application will listen to your voice through the microphone.
After speaking, the recognized speech will be displayed in the "Source Text" entry field, replacing any existing text.
Important Notes
This application relies on an internet connection to access the Google Translate API for language translation.
The accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on microphone quality and ambient noise.
